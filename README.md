## Fruit and Nutrient Classifier: Project Overview
Created a tool that takes an image of a fruit and classifies it into one of 131 different categories while also outputting the nutrients that fruit provides
Used over 100,000 images(obtained from Kaggle's fruit360 dataset) of different fruits to train and test the model using Tensorflow, CNNs, and data augmentation
Used rapidAPI to acquire information on the nutrients each fruit provides
Deployed the model using Google Cloud Platform and FastAPI
Tested both deployment methods using the Postman application
